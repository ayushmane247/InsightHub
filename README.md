## 🎬 The Story Behind InsightHub

> “Meet Rajesh. Every night he’d sit with endless Excel sheets, trying to make sense of daily sales.  
> He knew data held the answers—but had no idea where to begin.  
> That’s when **InsightHub** was born.  
> A tool not made for coders.  
> A tool made for **people like Rajesh**.”

InsightHub is more than a project — it's a **mission** to bring data intelligence to every shop, regardless of technical background.
